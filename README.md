# Online Quiz with JS

## Description

Creating this quiz was my 5th assignment from my GT Bootcamp course. I was not provided with any starter code, and I was given a mockup gif to replicate from scratch. The quiz had specific requirements, which I ensured to include in the code:

* Set a timer to start upon starting the quiz
* Iterate the questions to appear on the screen, one at a time
* Store the user's selection and verify whether they answered correctly or incorrectly
* Deduct 10 seconds from the timer, if the user answered incorrectly
* Upon completion of the quiz, save the score and display it for the user to see, and input their initials
* Save the score and initials of the user to Local Storage, so that it's saved on the browser
